# Safe Reinforcement Learning on a Robotic Arm
A student project comparing reinforcement learning algorithms on a panda robotic arm. Implemented PPO and its safety version, PPO Lagrangian, taking into account costs such as avoiding obstacles. Explore the potential of safeRL in robotics.

## Acknowledgement

For this project we are using reinforcement learning agents developed by OpenAI from [Safety Starter Agents](https://github.com/openai/safety-starter-agents).
For the environment we modified an existing OpenAI Gym environment for pybullet [gym-panda](https://github.com/mahyaret/gym-panda).

## Requirements

This environment was built on Ubuntu 22.04.

Requires **Python 3.6**.

## Installation

coming soon
